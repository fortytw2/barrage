On the way to Hikarizaka high school one day, Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent third-year student wishing for changes to occur in his life, meets a strange girl talking to herself named Nagisa Furukawa. Throughout the day, he is introduced to many of the main female characters; Kyou Fujibayashi and her sister Ryou Fujibayashi, astounded by their personalities. Later in the day, Tomoya has a conversation with Nagisa during lunch and learns that she is repeating her last year of high school, due to being absent too much because of illness, and wants to join the now-disbanded drama club. They watch when a female transfer student beats up two guys on motor bikes. After school, Tomoya goes to Nagisa's Furukawa family bakery and meets her eccentric parents, Akio Furukawa and Sanae Furukawa; he is invited to have dinner with them. """
